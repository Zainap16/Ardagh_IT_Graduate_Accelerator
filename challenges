Day 2

To tackle this task, create a new function called drawSquare in the terminal scribe class, which requires the square's size as an input parameter.

To construct the square, write four while loops, each one drawing a separate side of the square by iterating over a variable called i that starts at zero and increases by one each time it runs. 

To complete the square, draw the right, down, left, and up sides, in that order. To test the function outside the class, call the scribe.drawSquare method at the bottom of the code and passed the value of 20 as the square's size. This should produce a square with 20 units on each side. Let's give it a try.
