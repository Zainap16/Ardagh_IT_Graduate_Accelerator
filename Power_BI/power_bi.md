Power BI (Business Intelligence) 

# Getting Started

* Microsoft Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights

* Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, clean, and model your data without affecting the underlying source, visualize (or discover) what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

3 elements:

1. Power BI Desktop
2. Power BI Service
3. Power BI Mobile

Elements: datasets, reports and dashboards.
All elements are organized into workspaces and created on capacities.

Capacities:

Capacities are a core Power BI concept representing a set of resources used to host and deliver your Power BI content. Capacities are either shared or dedicated. A shared capacity is shared with other Microsoft customers, while a dedicated capacity is fully committed to a single customer. Dedicated capacities require a subscription. By default, workspaces are created on a shared capacity.

Workspaces:

- containers for dashboards, reports, datasets and dataflows in Power BI. 2 types of workpaces, namely: My Worspace and Workspaces.

* my workspace: is the personal workspace for any Power BI customer to work with your own content. Only you have access to your My workspace. You can share dashboards and reports from your My Workspace. If you want to collaborate on dashboards and reports or create an app, then you want to work in a workspace.
* Workspace: are used to collaborate and share content with colleagues. You can add colleagues to your workspaces and collaborate on dashboards, reports, and datasets. With one exception, all workspace members need Power BI Pro licenses.

### Semantic models
A semantic model is a collection of data that you import or connect to. Power BI lets you connect to and import all sorts of semantic models and bring all of them together in one place. Semantic models can also source data from dataflows.

### Reports
A Power BI report is one or more pages of visualizations such as line charts, maps, and other elements. You can create reports in Power BI from scratch, import them from shared dashboards, or have Power BI generate them when connecting to datasets

### Dashboards 

Why do people create dashboards? Here are just some of the reasons:

* To see all information needed to make decisions in one glance.

* To monitor the most important information about your business.

* To ensure all colleagues are on the same page, viewing and using the same information.

* To monitor the health of a business, product, business unit, or marketing campaign, etc.

* To create a personalized view of a larger dashboard and show all the metrics that matter to them.

### Describe cleaning and transforming data in Power BI Desktop

Power BI Desktop has three views:

Report view: You can create queries to build compelling visualizations that you can share with others. You can arrange them as you want them to appear.

Data view: See the data in your report in data model format, where you can add measures, create new columns, and manage relationships.

Model view: Get a graphical representation of the relationships that are established in your data model and manage or modify them as needed.
