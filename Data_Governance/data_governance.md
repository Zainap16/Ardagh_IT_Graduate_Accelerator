# Chapter One


##  Define Data Governance:
Data governance refers to the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used in an enterprise or organization. It involves establishing processes, policies, standards, and metrics to ensure that data assets are managed effectively and responsibly.

- is simple about proactively managing the quality of your data

## What is meant by governance


Data governance serves as a structured approach to overseeing the quality and utilization of data assets, enabling organizations to align with their strategic objectives and aspirations. Essentially, it revolves around the adept management of data resources. A finely-tuned data management strategy not only cultivates exponential growth but also positions data as a pivotal catalyst for achieving remarkable success within a company.

## The value of Data Governance

### Advantages ahcived by data governance includes: 

Improved data quality
Expanded data value
Increased data compliance
Improved data-driven decision-making
Enhanced business performance
Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
Increased data availability and accessibility
Improved data search
Reduced risks from data-related issues
Reduced data management costs
Established rules for handling data

### The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following. These steps also form the basic outline of this course.

Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
Achieving leadership approval.
Designing and developing the program.
Implementing the program.
Monitoring and measuring performance.
Maintaining the program.

Data Governance Versus Data Management

* . Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. 

* Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.

Data Governance versus Information Governance

* . Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences.

* Information Governance - business context

What is data culture?

* is the collective behaviors and beliefs of people who value, practice, and encourage the use of data to improve decision-making

## Maturing the Data Culture

Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

## The following basic checklist of items will help you determine the data governance readiness of your organization:

The basis of a data culture exists.
The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.

# Chapter Two

* Defining Data

Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device. These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer. Single units of data are traditionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data. 

Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically, at a high level, it falls into one of the following categories:

Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.
