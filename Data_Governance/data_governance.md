# Chapter One


##  Define Data Governance:
Data governance refers to the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used in an enterprise or organization. It involves establishing processes, policies, standards, and metrics to ensure that data assets are managed effectively and responsibly.

- is simple about proactively managing the quality of your data

## What is meant by governance


Data governance serves as a structured approach to overseeing the quality and utilization of data assets, enabling organizations to align with their strategic objectives and aspirations. Essentially, it revolves around the adept management of data resources. A finely-tuned data management strategy not only cultivates exponential growth but also positions data as a pivotal catalyst for achieving remarkable success within a company.

## The value of Data Governance

### Advantages ahcived by data governance includes: 

Improved data quality
Expanded data value
Increased data compliance
Improved data-driven decision-making
Enhanced business performance
Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
Increased data availability and accessibility
Improved data search
Reduced risks from data-related issues
Reduced data management costs
Established rules for handling data

### The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following. These steps also form the basic outline of this course.

Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
Achieving leadership approval.
Designing and developing the program.
Implementing the program.
Monitoring and measuring performance.
Maintaining the program.

Data Governance Versus Data Management

* . Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. 

* Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.

Data Governance versus Information Governance

* . Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences.

* Information Governance - business context

What is data culture?

* is the collective behaviors and beliefs of people who value, practice, and encourage the use of data to improve decision-making

## Maturing the Data Culture

Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

## The following basic checklist of items will help you determine the data governance readiness of your organization:

The basis of a data culture exists.
The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.

# Chapter Two

* Defining Data

Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device. These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer. Single units of data are traditionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data. 

Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically, at a high level, it falls into one of the following categories:

Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.

## Data-Driven Decision-Making
* Perhaps one of the greatest values of data is its ability to help us all make better decisions.

## Data as The New Oil
* A popular refrain coined by the mathematician Clive Humby in 2006 is that data is the new oil. Just as oil drove and grew economies in the past, data is doing that now. 

## Data Ownership

Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets. These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable. For example, data associated with intellectual property — items such as copyrights and trade secrets — will likely have high degrees of protection, from accessibility rights to who can use the data and for what purpose.

## Data Architecture

* When designing the technical needs of an organization to support its business strategy, this practice is known as enterprise architecture (EA).

* A subset of EA is data architecture

* Data architecture is the agreed blueprint for how data supports an organization’s functions and technologies.

At a minimum, data architecture considers and typically supports the following:

Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it.
Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations.
Adopting and agreeing to data standards
Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication

* Data architecture is a direct reflection of data governance. An established and functioning data architecture immediately signals that an organization values data, manages it as a critical business asset, and has controls in place to ensure that it aligns with business needs.

![asset-v1_CITI+DS+2023+type@asset+block@The_lifecycle_of_data](https://github.com/Zainap16/Ardagh_IT_Graduate_Accelerator/assets/122858207/1164be2a-0b71-4714-8ab6-4915266e4e69)

* Creation:  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.

* Storage:  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.
  
* Usage:  Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.

* Archival:  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.

* Destruction:  Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.

## The Role of The U.S. Census in The Information Revolution

The history of data processing dates back to the late 1800s, spurred by the need to efficiently tabulate census results. The Tabulating Machine Company, later IBM, pioneered automation in data processing by converting handwritten census results into punched cards. This marked the beginning of data storage and automation, leading to widespread adoption in various sectors like office, military, academia, and factories. This era of data processing laid the groundwork for the information age, characterized by a surge in data creation, storage, and utilization. The term "big data" emerged to describe the challenge of managing the unprecedented volume and velocity of data generated by the turn of the century.


## Defining Big Data

* Volume: The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.
* Variety: There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. This requires different methods of handling, from analysis to security.
* Velocity: With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed. Consider that in 2021, Instagram users created, uploaded, and share 65,000 pictures a minute.
* Variability:  The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.
* Veracity:  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.

Cambrian explosion — a term the data science community has adopted from an early period in history notable for the rapid introduction of life into the natural environmen

Smart data uses new processes and tools to make the data most useful. 

# Chapter Three

## Operations

Business operations concern themselves with a diverse set of activities to run the day-to-day needs and drive the mission of an organization. Each business has different needs, and operational functions reflect these specific requirements.

The performance of operations is often easily quantified by data

Operations use data to make decisions, enable systems to run, and deliver data to internal and external entities. For example, a regional sales team will deliver their monthly results to headquarters to be presented to vice presidents or the C-suite

## Strategy

Note: A best practice for strategy development is to consider it an ongoing process. This doesn’t mean updating the strategy every month — as strategies are intended to last for several years — but it may mean revisiting the strategy every six months and tweaking it as necessary. Revisions to strategy should be guided by new data, which can mean new knowledge and new insights. While a regular process of strategy revisions is encouraged, new information that suddenly presents itself can trigger an impromptu update.

## Decision-Making

## Measuring

## Insight Management

Insight management begins with gathering and analyzing data from different sources. In order to determine what data to process, those responsible for insight management must deeply understand the organization’s information needs. They must be knowledgeable about what data has value. In addition, these analysts must know how information flows across the organization and who it must reach.


## Other Roles for Data

* Artificial intelligence (AI):  Data is considered the fuel of AI. It requires a high volume of good data. With huge quantities of quality data, the outcomes of AI improve. It’s from the data that AI learns patterns, identifies relationships, and determines probabilities. In addition, AI is being used to improve the quality and use of data in organizations.
  
* Problem-solving:  Acknowledging the close association with decision-making, it’s worth calling out problem-solving as a distinctive use of data. Data plays a role in how a problem is defined, determining what solutions are available, evaluating which solution to use, and measuring the success or failure of the solution that is chosen and applied.

  
* Data reuse:  While we collect and use data for a specific primary purpose, data is often reused for entirely different reasons. Data that has been collected, used, and stored can be retrieved and used by a different team at another time - assuming they have permission, including access and legal rights (notable controls within data governance). For example, the sales team in an organization will collect your name and address in order to fulfill an order. Later, that same data set may be used by the marketing team to create awareness about other products and services. These are two different teams with different goals using the same data. Data reuse can be considered a positive given that it reduces data collection duplication and increases the value of data to an organization, but it must be managed with care so that it doesn’t break any data use rules. (Note: High-value shared data sets are called master data, and in data governance, they are subject to master data management.)

## Approaching Data as an Asset

Here are some examples of the economic value of data:

* Improves operations.
* Increases existing revenue.
* Produces new forms of revenue.
* Builds relationships with customers and other stakeholders.
* Improves the quality of products and services.
* Contributes to competitive advantage.
* Enables innovation.
* Reduces risk.

## Data Analytics

![asset-v1_CITI+DS+2023+type@asset+block@Basics_steps_in_data_analysis](https://github.com/Zainap16/Ardagh_IT_Graduate_Accelerator/assets/122858207/a4634d0f-5cd5-4955-a090-e7f2cc70b1d7)

* Descriptive:  Existing data sets of historical data are accessed, and analysis is performed to determine what the data tells stakeholders about the performance of a key performance indicator (KPI) or other business objectives. It is insight on past performance.
* Diagnostic:  As the term suggests, this analysis tries to glean from the data the answer to why something happened. It takes descriptive analysis and looks at the cause.
* Predictive:  In this approach, the analyst uses techniques to determine what may occur in the future. It applies tools and techniques to historical data and trends to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes.
* Prescriptive:  This analysis focuses on what action should be taken. In combination with predictive analytics, prescriptive techniques provide estimates of the probabilities of a variety of future outcomes.

## Data Management

Data governance concerns itself with, for example, defining the roles, policies, controls, and processes for increasing the quality and value of organizational data.

Data management is the implementation of data governance. Without data management, data governance is just wishful thinking. To get value from data, there must be execution.


# Chapter Four

data silo is a data repository controlled by an entity in an organization but not frequently shared or known by other parts of the business. Data silos hinder business efficiencies because they reduce collaboration and increase data inconsistencies. In addition, they are a source of risk, including security and regulatory issues.

Data catalogs - are an essential way that data governance can help solve these limitations.

 data sprawl — a term for the myriad of data types and sources that most businesses grapple with today (Data sprawl is the accumulation of vast amounts of data by organizations, to the point where they no longer know what data they have or what is happening with that data.)

Knowing what data is available is essential for the following reasons:

* Better informed decision-making.
* Ensuring compliance and regulatory requirements.
* Lower costs by avoiding duplicate system and data efforts.
* Improved data analytics and reporting.
* Higher performing systems.
* More efficient operations.
* Reducing data inconsistencies across the enterprise.

## Data Catalogs

The three essential benefits of data catalogs are:

* Finding data: Helps users identify and locate data that may be useful.
* Understanding data:  Answers a wide variety of data questions such as its purpose and who uses it.
* Making data more useful:  Creates visibility, describes value, and provides access to information.


![asset-v1_CITI+DS+2023+type@asset+block@A_basic_orientation_of_the_components_of_a_data_catalogue](https://github.com/Zainap16/Ardagh_IT_Graduate_Accelerator/assets/122858207/7cd95ca3-3dc0-4a72-92a9-79c85da9e6f3)

What makes a data catalog particularly valuable is that it contains data about the data. It’s called metadata.

A data catalog can contain three types of metadata: technical, business, and operational.

* Technical metadata:  Data about the design of a data set such as its tables, columns, file names, and other documentation related to the source system.
* Business metadata:  Organizational data such as a business description, how it is used, its relevancy, an assessment of data quality, and users and their interactions.
* Operational metadata:  Data such as when the data was last accessed, who accessed it, and when was it last backed up.

Examples of metadata include the following:

* Associated systems.
* File names.
* File locations.
* Data owners.
* Data descriptions.
* Dates created.
* Dates last modified.
* List of database tables and views.
* Data stewards.--refers to the lead role in a data governance project
* Size of data sets.
* Quality score.
* Comments

With a data catalog, an organization can:

* Know what data it has (and by extension, know what data is missing).
* Reduce data duplication.
* Increase operational efficiencies and innovation.
* Understand data quality.
* Manage compliance.
* Enjoy cost savings from improved operations.
* Ability to find data tops the list

Acquiring and applying insight from data means defining the following:

* Context: Understanding the environment and objectives of the outcome
* Need: Determining how insight will help to accomplish the objective
* Vision: Having ideas about how insight will help and what that might look like in practice
* Outcome:  Specifying how insights will be adopted and success will be measured

These dimensions can be used to answer questions such as:

* What data is required?
* Does the data exist?
* Is it current?
* Is it easily available?
* What format is the data in?
* What kind of data analysis is required?
* How will the data be presented?

## Data Analytics

Data analysis is concerned with identifying a data set, examining it, and reporting on any findings. It’s a subset of data analytics and it typically focuses on what data from the past tells us. 

 On the other hand, data analytics is a complete science that involves collecting, cleaning, organizing, storing, administering, and analyzing data. 

The source of data for analytics is one or a combination of the following:

* First-party data:  Data that an organization collects.
* Second-party data:  Data that is obtained from another organization.
* Third-party data:  Aggregated data obtained from a provider.

Typical uses of contemporary data analytics tools and techniques include:

* Vastly improved decision-making
* Focused marketing campaigns
* Understanding the competitive landscape
* Designing more innovative products
* Better customer service
* Improved operations
* Insights on customer behavior

## Data Monetization

Without a process to place a price on a data set - called data valuation - the value of a given data set may be highly subjective and may differ considerably between the perspectives of team members.

When data provides an economic benefit to an organization, it's called data monetization. 

* Cost value method:  Value is calculated by determining how much it costs to produce, store, and replace lost data. It’s a simple method and can be useful as a lightweight approach, but it is subjective and doesn’t necessarily account for the economic value that the data can produce.
* Market value approach:  Value is calculated by researching how comparable data is being priced in the open market. It’s a great approach if market-based comparable data exists but doesn’t work for the vast number of data sets that are not traded.
* Economic value approach:  Value is calculated by measuring the impact a data set has on the business’s bottom line. It’s a difficult approach because it may be nearly impossible to identify the specific value of the data relative to other contributors of value.
* With-and-without method:  Value is calculated by quantifying the impact on cash flow if a data set needs to be replaced. Scenarios with and without the data are explored and the difference between cash flow is used to determine data value. Like others, this can be challenging to pinpoint the specific impact of a data set.

Assuming your organization realizes that data is a strategic corporate asset, you must be intentional in how you manage that asset. Called data asset management, a business must know what data sets it has and understand their value. It must have a plan for utilization and a mechanism to measure return on investment.

## Data-Driven Decision Making

data-driven decision-making (DDDM) is the process of using data to drive business decisions.

Consider this six-step process to data-driven decision-making:

1. Define the objectives:  This step involves understanding the objectives relative to the effort and their alignment with organizational goals. This will help you scope the work and define the metrics. In fact, it can be useful to define success and then work backward. For example, if you’re trying to increase sales in a particular region, you need to identify which metrics to capture in order to determine whether you achieved that objective.
2. Identify the data:  In addition to using a data catalogue, enterprise search, or similar, this step requires engaging with impacted stakeholders. Getting input from a diverse group of people and teams will help you scope the data. This may generate the need to gather data that doesn’t exist. You may need to consult with data stewards, data owners, and others with data governance responsibilities.
3. Prepare the data:  After Step 2, you'll understand the degree of preparation you need. If the problem you’re trying to solve is narrow and the data is easily accessible and high-quality, you’ll be in pretty good shape. In most cases, your situation is unlikely to be simple. The data necessary to meet your decision-making objectives will likely come in a variety of formats and will be in need of some remediation. You may need some deep data science skills to prepare the data for use in a data analytics platform.
4. Analyze the data:  Once you reach this point, the most exciting part begins. The assumption is that you’re using a useful analytics tool. For complex analysis and continuous efforts, several tools will be used. This could include support for an ETL architecture (Extract, Transform, and Load). This is when data is extracted from one system and made ready and available for use in another. To analyze this data, you will also need relevant representations such as visualizations. These could include graphs and charts. Your tool selection and how the data is presented will depend largely on the audience. For executives, a dashboard may be the right approach.
5. Determine the findings:  Once you have data that you can display in a variety of ways, you can ask questions about it. For example, if you’re trying to understand customer demographics relative to sales in a particular region, you may want to toggle between different age ranges. While all phases of DDDM have complexity, the tough work here is knowing which questions to ask. This skill is aided by training, but experience helps.
6. Take action:  That’s all there is to this step. Make your decisions. If you’ve completed Steps 1-5 well, but no action is taken (assuming that’s not the decision based on analyzing the data since concluding that no decision is necessary is, in fact, a decision), you’ve wasted a lot of time. DDDM is all about the decisions that result in actions.


The purpose of any type of strategy is to agree on a set of guiding principles that inform decision-making in support of a desired outcome. In simple terms, it’s the roadmap on how to reach your goals.

## Creating a Data Strategy

So, you’ve made the decision to create a data strategy. That’s great. Before jumping in, consider the following characteristics as a guide to your approach:

* Data maturity:  This can be defined simply as the degree to which the organization already uses and optimizes data and has experience and skills, as well as the quality of the existing data. All organizations use data, but there’s a big difference between those that have prioritized it for a long period and those just deciding to treat it as a strategic asset. For example, without some basic data standards, security policies, and a process to cleanse data, layering analytics on top of it will likely cause frustration and in the worst case, errors in the results.
* Industry and size: You can think of data prioritization through two frameworks: defense and offense. Defense deals with fundamental areas such as data security and quality. Offense is using data for insight management and market-facing initiatives. Every organization does both, but most emphasize one over the other depending on the industry and its size. For example, a healthcare company may prioritize a defense framework for data given the highly regulated nature of the industry.

## A data strategy should typically account for these five areas of data requirements:

* Identify:  To find and make data usable, it must be clearly defined and described. This includes a file name, a file format, and metadata.
* Store:  Design and develop the capabilities for supporting the place and process for hosting data and how it will be shared, accessed, and processed.
* Provision:  Determine the processes to share and reuse data and define the guidelines for access.
* Process:  Raw data must be transformed to become valuable. This includes processes for data cleansing, standardization, and integration with other data sets.
* Govern:  Institute processes to manage and communicate data policies for data use within the organization.

## Data requirements should consider these four data strategy components:

* Alignment with the business: A data strategy is a subset of the overall business strategy. This means the data strategy must support and advance the larger goals of the organization. When determining the goals of the data strategy, where possible, map them as clearly as possible to illustrate how they are in support of the business strategy. For example, the business may want to reduce customer acquisition costs. A data strategy will be a valuable way to identify potential customers with a higher likelihood of conversion to buyers. Keep in mind that the strategy of a business evolves constantly, sometimes slowly and other times quickly. Your data strategy has to evolve in sync, as appropriate.
* Identifying roles and responsibilities: A strategy requires people to take specific actions. Without action, a strategy is a worthless document. In the data strategy, you’ll want to document the different roles that team members will play. Most will be data consumers. These are the employees who access and use data. They will certainly have responsibilities. For example, there will be an expectation about how different classifications of data should be handled. If something is public, then that’s entirely different than something that’s confidential. However, the bulk of the responsibility for ensuring that a data strategy can be delivered and maintained will rest with team members such as the information technology staff, data scientists and analysts, data stewards and owners, and management. It will be quickly apparent that data strategy and data governance have overlapping and dependent goals. 
* Data architecture: This area relates to the processes, systems, and applications that support working with data. Basic areas include defining data storage needs and analysis tools. It also includes items such as a data catalog, a data warehouse where data can be stored and made ready for analysis, and the methods and tools for data pipelines, moving data from a data source to a destination, and related ETL (extract, transform, and load) functions. A data strategy should support the scalability of your data architecture as well as have some flexibility as needs change. Note that data architecture is often the driver of choosing and designing data management processes and systems.
* Data management: This area is the broad umbrella of activities that manage the full lifecycle of data in an organization. It recognizes that data is a strategic asset and must have the attendant processes, procedures, policies, skills, and tools to ensure it is treated in such a manner. This includes areas such as the management of data security and privacy, quality, metadata, integration, master data management, and analytics.
