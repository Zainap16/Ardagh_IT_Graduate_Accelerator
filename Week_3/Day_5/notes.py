"""
Save Configuration Settings: Modify your program to store configuration settings in a file or a database. When the program starts, it can read the settings from the storage and apply them, ensuring that the changes made by the admin are retained across program restarts.
Customizable Content for Recipients: Allow recipients to individually customize the content they want to receive in their digest. This could involve creating a settings section for recipients, where they can select their preferred content categories or topics.
Personalized Weather Forecast: Enhance the weather forecast by customizing it for each recipient's location. You can include an additional field in the recipient's information to store their location, and then use an appropriate weather API to fetch location-specific forecasts.
Timezone-based Email Sending: Adjust the sending time of the email digest based on each recipient's timezone. This way, all recipients receive the digest at a time that's relative to their day.
Notifying Admin of Unavailable Content Sources: Implement a mechanism to notify the admin when a content source becomes unavailable or encounters an issue. This could involve periodically checking the availability of content sources and sending notifications or generating error logs when issues arise.
Persistent Application as a Scheduled Service: Modify your application to run as a scheduled service rather than requiring the Python interpreter to be left running continuously. You can use operating system-specific mechanisms (e.g., cron jobs on Unix-like systems) to schedule the program's execution at the desired time.
Secure Storage of Sensitive Information: Improve the security of your application by finding a more secure way to store sensitive information like sender credentials and API keys. Consider using encryption or storing the credentials in a separate configuration file with restricted access.
GUI Improvements:  Enhance the visual appeal and usability of your GUI. This could involve refining the layout, adding icons, using color schemes, or incorporating user-friendly features like tooltips or keyboard shortcuts.
