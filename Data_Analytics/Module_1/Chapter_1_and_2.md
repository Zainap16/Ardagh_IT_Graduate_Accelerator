## Chpater 1

### Data Analytics:
* Conceptional understanding of data (theoretical aspect)
* Hands-on manipulation of data (practical aspect)

1. What the role of a Data Analyst is and the scope of data analytics.
2. The process of data analytics. 
3. The techniques of data analytics.
4. The role of data governance

Data analyst role is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization. Key responsibilities:

1. Data Collection & Preparation:
    * Sourcing data from various channels (databases, spreadsheets and external sources).
    *  Cleaning & organizing data to ensure: accuracy, consistency and ready for analysis.
2. Data Analytics:
    *  Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques/other analytic tools to interpret data.
    *  Identify trends, patterns & correlations that might not be immediately obvious.
3. Data visualization & storytelling:
    *  Creating visual representations of the data (charts, graphs, & dashboards to make complex info easily understandable)
    *  Articulating findings I a compelling narrative to comms the significance of data to stakeholders.
4. Decision Support
    *  Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions
    *  Providing context around data, including potential implications & future trends
5. Collaboration & Comms
    *  Working closely with other departments, like marketing, finance & operations to understand their data needs & provide insight.
    *  Effectively comms complex data findings in a clear & concise manner to non-technical stakeholders.
6. Continuous learning & adaptation:
    *  Keeping up to date with the latest industry trends, tools & technologies in data analysis.
Adapting new types of data & analytical methods as the organization's needs to evolve.


### Responsibilties of DA:

*Moore's Law* _is a prediction made by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, in 1965. Simply put, it states that the number of transistors (tiny switches) on a computer chip doubles about every two years, leading to an exponential increase in computing power. This doubling occurs while the cost of computer chips remains roughly the same. In simpler terms, it means that over time, computers become faster, more powerful, and cheaper to produce. This law has held true for many decades and has been a driving force behind the rapid advancement of technology._ 

### Occupation of DA:

### Analytic Process:

    • Data acquisition.
    • Cleaning and manipulation
    • Analysis
    • Visualization
    • Reporting and communication

### Notes:

    • The analytic process is iterative.
    • Analytics:
        ○ Descriptive A
        ○ Predictive A
        ○ Prescriptive A

### Machine learning, artificial intelligence and deep learning:

    • ML - uses algorithms to discover knowledge in your dataset. Some cases where machine learning commonly adds value:
        ○ Discovering anomalies in system and application logs that may be indicative of cybersecurity incident.
        ○ Forecasting product sales based on market and environmental conditions.
        ○ Setting prices for hotel rooms far in advanced based on forecasted demand.
        ○ Forecasting product sales based on market & environmental conditions.
    • Artificial Intelligence (AI) - includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior. Basically asking the computer system to artificiality behave as if they were intelligent.
    • Machine Learning (ML) - subset of AI techniques attempt to apply stats to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge. 
    • Deep Learning - subdivision of ML uses complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a certain way. Its commonly used for image, video, & sound analysis.

### Relationship between AI, ML & DL

#### DA tools
    • Spreadsheets (excel) & google sheets
    • R programming (advanced) - RStudio

CHAPTER 2: UNDERSTADING DATA

*data element* is an attribute about a person, place or thing which contains data within a range of values. They also s=describe characteristics of activities including orders/transaction/events. (pet name, animal type -- heading names)

*data type* limits the values a data element can have.

## Tabular Data

* Tabular data is data organized into a table, made up of columns and rows. 

* A table represents information about a single topic. Each column represents a uniquely named field within a table, also called a variable, about a single characteristic.

* Relational database management system (RDMS), - named as a database, extends the tabular model. Instead of having all data in a single table, a database organizes related data across multiple tables.

* The connection between tables is known as a relationship. Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are examples of database software. Tabular data is the concept that underpins both spreadsheets and relational databases.

### Structured Data Types:

* Structured data is tabular in nature and organized into rows and columns. Structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreadsheet. With clearly defined column headings, spreadsheets are easy to work with and understand. In a spreadsheet, cells are where columns and rows intersect.

#### Character:

The character data type limits data entry to only valid characters. Characters can include the alphabet that you might see on your keyboard, as well as numbers. Depending on your needs, multiple data types are available that can enforce character limits.

* Alphanumeric is the most widely used data type for storing character-based data. As the name implies, alphanumeric is appropriate when a data element consists of both numbers and letters

* Alphanumeric data type is ideal for storing product stock-keeping units (SKUs)
