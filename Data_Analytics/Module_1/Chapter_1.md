### Data Analytics:
* Conceptional understanding of data (theoretical aspect)
* Hands-on manipulation of data (practical aspect)

1. What the role of a Data Analyst is and the scope of data analytics.
2. The process of data analytics. 
3. The techniques of data analytics.
4. The role of data governance

Data analyst role is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization. Key responsibilities:

1. Data Collection & Preparation:
    * Sourcing data from various channels (databases, spreadsheets and external sources).
    *  Cleaning & organizing data to ensure: accuracy, consistency and ready for analysis.
2. Data Analytics:
    *  Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques/other analytic tools to interpret data.
    *  Identify trends, patterns & correlations that might not be immediately obvious.
3. Data visualization & storytelling:
    *  Creating visual representations of the data (charts, graphs, & dashboards to make complex info easily understandable)
    *  Articulating findings I a compelling narrative to comms the significance of data to stakeholders.
4. Decision Support
    *  Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions
    *  Providing context around data, including potential implications & future trends
5. Collaboration & Comms
    *  Working closely with other departments, like marketing, finance & operations to understand their data needs & provide insight.
    *  Effectively comms complex data findings in a clear & concise manner to non-technical stakeholders.
6. Continuous learning & adaptation:
    *  Keeping up to date with the latest industry trends, tools & technologies in data analysis.
Adapting new types of data & analytical methods as the organization's needs to evolve.

*Moore's Law* _is a prediction made by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, in 1965. Simply put, it states that the number of transistors (tiny switches) on a computer chip doubles about every two years, leading to an exponential increase in computing power. This doubling occurs while the cost of computer chips remains roughly the same. In simpler terms, it means that over time, computers become faster, more powerful, and cheaper to produce. This law has held true for many decades and has been a driving force behind the rapid advancement of technology._

### Analytic Process:

    • Data acquisition.
    • Cleaning and manipulation
    • Analysis
    • Visualization
    • Reporting and communication

### Notes:

    • The analytic process is iterative.
    • Analytics:
        ○ Descriptive A
        ○ Predictive A
        ○ Prescriptive A

### Machine learning, artificial intelligence and deep learning:

    • ML - uses algorithms to discover knowledge in your dataset. Some cases where machine learning commonly adds value:
        ○ Discovering anomalies in system and application logs that may be indicative of cybersecurity incident.
        ○ Forecasting product sales based on market and environmental conditions.
        ○ Setting prices for hotel rooms far in advanced based on forecasted demand.
        ○ Forecasting product sales based on market & environmental conditions.
    • Artificial Intelligence (AI) - includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior. Basically asking the computer system to artificiality behave as if they were intelligent.
    • Machine Learning (ML) - subset of AI techniques attempt to apply stats to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge. 
    • Deep Learning - subdivision of ML uses complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a certain way. Its commonly used for image, video, & sound analysis.

### Relationship between AI, ML & DL
