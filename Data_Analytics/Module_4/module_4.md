## Data Use Agreements

A data use agreement (DUA) is a contractual document for transferring private data between organizations. You should establish a DUA before sharing data with an outside party. It is essential to understand the classification for each piece of data when crafting a DUA. The more sensitive a data element is, the more critical it is to prepare appropriate sharing-related language.
