Mapping Type: Dictionary (dict).
Set Types: Set (set) and frozen set (frozenset).

Data Structures:

Lists: Ordered collection of items that can be changed (mutable).

Sets: Unordered collection of unique items, useful for mathematical operations like union, intersection, etc.
Arrays: Homogeneous collection of items of a single

Conditional Statements: if, elif, and else for executing different blocks of code based on conditions.
Loops: for loop for iterating over a sequence, while loop for executing a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.

Defining Functions: def keyword to define functions.
Arguments and Return Values: Functions can take arguments (inputs) and return values (outputs).
Scope: Local and global scope of variables.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
